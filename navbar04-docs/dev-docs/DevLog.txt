Instructions for this "Developer Log": 
--------------------------------------
Purpose:
--------
The purpose of this log file is to provide a lightweight 
chronological record of the development work that was 
done on this website.  

Log Organization:
-----------------
This log file is divided into sequentially numbered 
sections.  Each section contains details about the work 
that was done on a single work sessiono on a single day.


Example Log File Usage: 
-----------------------
a. before you began work today, you opened this log file, scrolled 
   down to the bottom of the file and observed that the last log 
   entry used number 440.
 
   Then you created a new log entry using the next sequential number 
   which was 450.  We are numbering by 10's so we can insert a log 
   entry at a later date.


This line should now look like this: 

----------------------------------------------------------------
DevLogNumber 450 


b. Below this line, you entered the current date, your name, and a 
   short description of what you are working on.

This section should now look like this:

Prepared requirements package for this project. 
- created GitHub repo for this project. 
- created a local Git repo and synced it with the remote repo
- created repo folders to organize the files.
- copied supporting documents into the local repo. 
- Queried GitHub to confirm that it is safe to store a binary file 
  (a .zip file that contains a Wix website template) in this repo,  
  retrieve it later from this repo, and import that website back 
  into a Wix workspace. 

  GitHub says this will work... need to test that soon.  If that 
  does not work, we will have to abandon using a GitHub repo. 

  Create a contract for Muhammad Akbar and ask him to perform this 
  test: 
  - Clone the Navbar04-Project01-A to his local PC. 
  - In wix, save any website as a template and export it into a 
    .zip file. 
  - Save the zip file in the local repository
  - In the local repo, commit all changes 
  - Push the local repo up to GitHub
  - Navigate to a blank folder, and open it with VSCode. 
  - Clone the remote repo into the new folder. 
  - In the new folder, unzip the template file and import it into 
    the Wix workspace. 
  - Preview the imported website to confirm that is working OK. 
    - Perform multiple developer operations like:
      - preview the website
      - publish the website and access it from a web browser.
      - add some additional sections to the web page. 
      - preview again, publish again.
