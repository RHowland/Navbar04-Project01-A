Prepared the requirements package for this project. 
- created a GitHub repo for this project and cloned it to my 
  local PC.
- created repo folders to organize the files.
- copied supporting documents into the local repo. 

I ran into problems with designing the developer workflow due 
to my being a beginner with Wix development.  

So, I have to do additional research.

Continued work on the Requirements Document
- The name for this requirements document is:
    "Navbar04 ReqDoc01 V1A (Dev Name).txt" 

- The "04" number in "Navbar04" states that this is the 4th 
  completely new version of this same navbar component that is 
  being developed by Rich Howland.  

- "ReqDoc" = abbreviation for "Requirements Document"

- The "01" in "ReqDoc01" states that this is the first requirements 
  document for the Navbar04 component. 

- The "V1A" notation defines the DOCUMENT VERSION for the 
  requirements document. 
  - "V" = "version"
  - "1" = major version number    
  - "A" = minor version number    (A, B, C, etc)

  Every time that Rich changes the requirements document, he 
  will increment the letter from "A", to "B", to "C", etc. 

- The "(Dev Name)" section states the name of the Lead Developer 
  for the Navbar04 component. 

    Example: "Navbar04 ReqDoc01 V1A (Mary D.).txt"
