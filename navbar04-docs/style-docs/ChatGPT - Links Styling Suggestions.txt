Wix Developer: 
I have provided two versions of this document: 
- a .pdf file for readability.
- this .txt file so you can copy the Velo code 
  if find it helpful to you. 


Prompt sent to ChatGPT:
-----------------------

In Wix Studio editor, is it possible to make the line color 
different from the link text color?  I have two links that 
have white text color with a dark gray background.  I want 
the underlines to show, but I want them to be a 
medium-to-light gray."

Here is the text for the two links: 
   800-123-4567        How we build your website

In hover mode, I want the color of the underline to change to 
a light blue color. 

For the "800-123-4567" phone number text, link to the 
"create-phone-call" webpage.

For the "How we build your website" text, link to the 
"Our Process" webpage.

Please show me how to do this using designer options and Velo 
code as needed.

========================================================

ChatGPT Response: 
Goal: You want to create two links in Wix Studio with:

White text on a dark gray background

Medium-light gray underlines (not default text color)

Light blue underlines on hover

Custom destinations per link (internal pages)

Achieved using Wix Studio designer tools + Velo code if needed


‚úÖ Step-by-Step (Wix Studio Editor ‚Äì Designer Only)
If you're trying to avoid custom code, do this using the editor:

‚ë† Add Two Text Elements
Drag two text elements onto the canvas.

Use Rich Text or set both as "Paragraph 1" or "Custom" ‚Äî you can format part of the text separately.

Enter this text:

800-123-4567

How we build your website

‚ë° Convert Text to Links
Highlight 800-123-4567, click the link icon in the toolbar, and select Page ‚Üí choose create-phone-call page.

Do the same for How we build your website ‚Üí link to Our Process page.

‚ë¢ Apply White Text & Dark Gray Background
Set Text Color = White #FFFFFF

Set Background Color of the container = Dark Gray #1E1E1E or your choice

‚ë£ Create a Custom Underline Effect
Wix Studio doesn‚Äôt natively let you set underline color separately, but you can:

Remove the built-in underline using:

Text > Decoration > None

Use Border-bottom workaround:

Add a Box below each link with:

Height: 1px

Width: 100% of the link

Background color: Medium-light gray (e.g., #B0B0B0)

Position it manually just under the link

For hover effect:

Select the Box

Click the Interactions (‚ö°) tab

Add a Hover State

In the Hover State: Change background color of the box to #ADD8E6 (light blue)

This achieves visual separation of text and underline color without code.

‚úÖ Alternative: Do It with Velo Code (Precise Control)
If you want full control using Wix Velo, here‚Äôs how to implement it using HTML inside a Rich Text box or in code:

‚ë† Use an HTML Component or Rich Text Element
Drag an HTML embed or Rich Text element

Insert this code:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- custom-links.html -->
<p style="background-color: #1e1e1e; padding: 8px;">
  <a href="/create-phone-call"
     style="color: white; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #B0B0B0;"
     onmouseover="this.style.borderBottomColor='#ADD8E6';"
     onmouseout="this.style.borderBottomColor='#B0B0B0';">
    800-123-4567
  </a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a href="/our-process"
     style="color: white; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #B0B0B0;"
     onmouseover="this.style.borderBottomColor='#ADD8E6';"
     onmouseout="this.style.borderBottomColor='#B0B0B0';">
    How we build your website
  </a>
</p>
This will:

Show white text links

Underlines appear in light gray

On hover, underline changes to light blue

Work cleanly in both desktop and mobile views
